The UN creates a world happiness report every year, in which they give every country a happiness score based off a variety of factors
such as GDP, life expectancy, and government corruption. I use a linear regression model inorder to understand how each of the independent
variables affect the dependent variable i.e the happiness score. I found that GDP, life expectancy, family, and freedom were the only 
statistically significant variables with respect to the dependent variable. I also found that life expectancy was extremely skewed 
compared to other variables i.e there was a great difference between developing countries and modern industrial countries with respect to life expectancy.
